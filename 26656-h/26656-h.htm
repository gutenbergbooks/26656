<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>


<p>This is the second volume of a series intended to present, in accurate
colored portraiture, and in popular and juvenile biographical text, a very
considerable portion of the common birds of North America, and many of the
more interesting and attractive specimens of other countries, in many respects
superior to all other publications which have attempted the representation of
birds, and at infinitely less expense. The appreciative reception by the public of
Vol. I deserves our grateful acknowledgement. Appearing in monthly parts,
it has been read and admired by thousands of people, who, through the
life-like pictures presented, have made the acquaintance of many birds,
and have since become enthusiastic observers of them. It has been introduced
into the public schools, and is now in use as a text book by hundreds of
teachers, who have expressed enthusiastic approval of the work and of its
general extension. The faithfulness to nature of the pictures, in color and
pose, have been commended by such ornithologists and authors as Dr. Elliott
Coues, Mr. John Burroughs, Mr. J. W. Allen, editor of <em>The Auk</em>, Mr. Frank M.
Chapman, Mr. J. W. Baskett, and others.</p>

<p>The general text of <span class="smcap">Birds</span>&mdash;the biographies&mdash;has been conscientiously
prepared from the best authorities by a careful observer of the feather-growing
denizens of the field, the forest, and the shore, while the juvenile autobiographies
have received the approval of the highest ornithological authority.</p>

<p>The publishers take pleasure in the announcement that the general excellence
of <span class="smcap">Birds</span> will be maintained in subsequent volumes. The subjects
selected for the third and fourth volumes&mdash;many of them&mdash;will be of the rare
beauty in which the great Audubon, the limner <em>par excellence</em> of birds, would
have found &ldquo;the joy of imitation.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>BIRD SONG.</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 116px;">
<img src="images/imgw.png" width="116" height="80" alt="W" title="" />
</div>
<p>E made several early morning
excursions into the
woods and fields during
the month of June, and
were abundantly rewarded in many
ways&mdash;by beholding the gracious
awakening of Nature in her various
forms, kissed into renewed activity by
the radiance of morn; by the sweet
smelling air filled with the perfume of
a multitude of opening flowers which
had drunk again the dew of heaven;
by the sight of flitting clouds across
the bluest of skies, patching the green
earth with moving shadows, and sweetest
of all, by the twittering, calling,
musical sounds of love and joy which
came to the ear from the throats of the
feathered throng. How pleasant to
lie prone on one&#8217;s back on the cool
grass, and gaze upward through the
shady green canopy of boughs, watching
the pretty manoeuvers, the joyous
greetings, the lively anxieties, the
graceful movements, and even the
sorrowful happenings of the bird-life
above us.</p>

<p>Listen to the variety of their tones,
as manifest as the difference of form
and color. What more interesting
than to observe their habits, and discover
their cosy nests with their beautiful
eggs in the green foliage? Strange
that so many persons think only of
making a collection of them, robbing
the nests with heartless indifference to
the suffering of the parents, to say
nothing of the invasion which they
make of the undoubted rights the birds
have from nature to protection and
perpetuation.</p>

<p>Strictly speaking, there are few
birds to which the word &ldquo;singing&rdquo;
can properly be applied, the majority
of them not having more than two or
three notes, and they with little suggestion
of music in them. Chanticleer
crows, his spouse cackles or
clucks, as may be suitable to the
occasion. To what ear are these
noises musical? They are rather language,
and, in fact, the varying notes of
every species of bird have a significance
which can alone be interpreted by its
peculiar habits. If careful note be
made of the immediate conduct of the
male or female bird, as the case may
be, after each call or sound, the meaning
of it becomes plain.</p>

<p>A hen whose chicks are scattered in
search of food, upon seeing a hawk,
utters a note of warning which we
have all heard, and the young scamper
to her for protection beneath her
wings. When she has laid an egg,
<em>Cut-cut-cut-cut-ot-cut!</em> announces it from
the nest in the barn. When the chicks
are hatched, her <em>cluck, cluck, cluck</em>,
calls them from the nest in the wide
world, and her <em>chick, chick, chick</em>, uttered
quickly, selects for them the dainty
which she has found, or teaches them
what is proper for their diet. A good
listener will detect enough intonations
in her voice to constitute a considerable
vocabulary, which, if imitated</p>

<h2>THE AMERICAN OSPREY.</h2>


<p>Here is the picture of a
remarkable bird. We know
him better by the name Fish
Hawk. He looks much like the
Eagle in July &ldquo;<span class="smcap">Birds.</span>&rdquo; The
Osprey has no use for Mr. Eagle
though.</p>

<p>You know the Bald Eagle or
Sea Eagle is very fond of fish.
Well, he is not a very good
fisherman and from his lofty
perch he watches for the Fish
Hawk or Osprey. Do you ask
why? Well, when he sees a
Fish Hawk with his prey, he is
sure to chase him and take it
from him. It is for this reason
that Ospreys dislike the Bald
Eagle.</p>

<p>Their food is fish, which as a
rule they catch alive.</p>

<p>It must be interesting to watch
the Osprey at his fishing. He
wings his way slowly over the
water, keeping a watch for fish
as they appear near the surface.</p>

<p>When he sees one that suits
him, he hovers a moment, and
then, closing his wings, falls
upon the fish.</p>

<p>Sometimes he strikes it with
such force that he disappears in
the water for a moment. Soon
we see him rise from the water
with the prey in his claws.</p>

<p>He then flies to some tall tree
and if he has not been discovered
by his enemy, the Eagle, can
have a good meal for his hard
work.</p>

<p>Look at his claws; then think
of them striking a fish as they
must when he plunges from on
high.</p>

<p>A gentleman tells of an Osprey
that fastened his claws in a fish
that was too large for him.</p>

<p>The fish drew him under and
nothing more was seen of Mr.
Osprey. The same gentleman
tells of a fish weighing six
pounds that fell from the claws
of a Fish Hawk that became
frightened by an Eagle.</p>

<p>The Osprey builds his nest
much like the Bald Eagle. It is
usually found in a tall tree and
out of reach.</p>

<p>Like the Eagle, he uses the
same nest each year, adding to
it. Sometimes it measures five
feet high and three feet across.
One nest that was found, contained
enough sticks, cornstalks,
weeds, moss, and the like, to fill
a cart, and made a load for a
horse to draw. Like the Crows
and Blackbirds they prefer to
live together in numbers. Over
three hundred nests have been
found in the trees on a small
island.</p>

<p>One thing I want you to
remember about the Osprey.
They usually remain mated for
life.</p>

<h2>THE AMERICAN OSPREY.</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 93px;">
<img src="images/imga1.png" width="93" height="80" alt="A" title="" />
</div>
<p>N interesting bird, &ldquo;Winged
Fisher,&rdquo; as he has been happily
called, is seen in places
suited to his habits,
throughout temperate
North America, particularly about
islands and along the seacoast. At
Shelter Island, New York, they are
exceedingly variable in the choice of
a nesting place. On Gardiner&#8217;s Island
they all build in trees at a distance
varying from ten to seventy-five feet
from the ground; on Plum Island,
where large numbers of them nest,
many place their nests on the ground,
some being built up to a height of four
or five feet while others are simply a
few sticks arranged in a circle, and the
eggs laid on the bare sand. On Shelter
Island they build on the chimneys of
houses, and a pair had a nest on the
cross-bar of a telegraph pole. Another
pair had a nest on a large rock. These
were made of coarse sticks and sea
weed, anything handy, such as bones,
old shoes, straw, etc. A curious nest
was found some years ago on the coast
of New Jersey. It contained three
eggs, and securely imbedded in the
loose material of the Osprey&#8217;s nest
was a nest of the Purple Grackle,
containing five eggs, while at the
bottom of the Hawk&#8217;s nest was a thick,
rotten limb, in which was a Tree
Swallow&#8217;s nest of seven eggs.</p>

<p>In the spring and early autumn this
familiar eagle-like bird can be seen
hovering over creek, river, and sound.
It is recognized by its popular name of
Fish-Hawk. Following a school of
fish, it dashes from a considerable
height to seize its prey with its stout
claws. If the fish is small it is at once
swallowed, if it is large, (and the Osprey
will occasionally secure shad,
blue fish, bass, etc., weighing five or
six pounds,) the fish is carried to a
convenient bluff or tree and torn to bits.
The Bald Eagle often robs him of
the fish by seizing it, or startling him
so that he looses his hold.</p>

<p>The Osprey when fishing makes one
of the most breezy, spirited pictures
connected with the feeding habits of
any of our birds, as often there is a
splashing and a struggle under water
when the fish grasped is too large
or the great talons of the bird gets
entangled. He is sometimes carried
under and drowned, and large fish
have been washed ashore with these
birds fastened to them by the claws.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mabel Osgood Wright says: &ldquo;I
found an Osprey&#8217;s nest in a crooked
oak on Wakeman&#8217;s Island in late April,
1893. As I could not get close to the
nest (the island is between a network
of small creeks, and the flood tides
covered the marshes,) I at first thought
it was a monstrous crow&#8217;s nest, but on
returning the second week in May I
saw a pair of Ospreys coming and going
to and fro from the nest. I hoped
the birds might return another season,
as the nest looked as if it might have
been used for two or three years, and
was as lop-sided as a poorly made haystack.
The great August storm of the
same year broke the tree, and the nest
fell, making quite a heap upon the
ground. Among the debris were
sticks of various sizes, dried reeds, two
bits of bamboo fishing rod, seaweeds,
some old blue mosquito netting, and
some rags of fish net, also about half
a bushel of salt hay in various stages
of decomposition, and malodorous dirt
galore.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is well known that Ospreys,
if not disturbed, will continue indefinitely
to heap rubbish upon their nests
till their bulk is very great. Like the
Owls they can reverse the rear toe.</p>

<h2>THE SORA RAIL.</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 87px;">
<img src="images/imgv.png" width="87" height="80" alt="V" title="" />
</div>
<p>ARIOUS are the names required
to distinguish the
little slate-colored Carolina
Rail from its brethren, Sora,
Common Rail, and, on the Potomac
river, Ortolan, being among them.
He is found throughout temperate
North America, in the weedy swamps
of the Atlantic states in great abundance,
in the Middle states, and in California.
In Ohio he is a common summer
resident, breeding in the extensive
swamps and wet meadows. The
nest is a rude affair made of grass and
weeds, placed on the ground in a tussock
of grass in a boggy tract of land,
where there is a growth of briers, etc.,
where he may skulk and hide in the
wet grass to elude observation. The
nest may often be discovered at a distance
by the appearance of the surrounding
grass, the blades of which
are in many cases interwoven over the
nest, apparently to shield the bird
from the fierce rays of the sun, which
are felt with redoubled force on the
marshes.</p>

<p>The Rails feed on both vegetable
and animal food. During the months
of September and October, the weeds
and wild oats swarm with them.
They feed on the nutricious seeds,
small snail shells, worms and larvae of
insects, which they extract from the
mud. The habits of the Sora Rail,
its thin, compressed body, its aversion
to take wing, and the dexterity with
which it runs or conceals itself among
the grass and sedge, are exactly similar
to those of the more celebrated
Virginia Rail.</p>

<p>The Sora frequents those parts of
marshes preferably where fresh water
springs rise through the morass. Here
it generally constructs its nest, &ldquo;one
of which,&rdquo; says an observer, &ldquo;we had
the good fortune to discover. It was
built in the bottom of a tuft of grass
in the midst of an almost impenetrable
quagmire, and was composed altogether
of old wet grass and rushes.
The eggs had been flooded out of the
nest by the extraordinary rise of the
tide in a violent northwest storm, and
lay scattered about the drift weed.
The usual number of eggs is from six
to ten. They are of a dirty white or
pale cream color, sprinkled with specks
of reddish and pale purple, most numerous
near the great end.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When on the wing the Sora Rail flies
in a straight line for a short distance
with dangling legs, and suddenly
drops into the water.</p>

<p>The Rails have many foes, and
many nests are robbed of their eggs by
weasels, snakes, Blackbirds, and Marsh
Hawks, although the last cannot
disturb them easily, as the Marsh
Hawk searches for its food while flying
and a majority of the Rails&#8217; nests
are covered over, making it hard to
distinguish them when the Hawk is
above.</p>

<h2>THE SORA RAIL.</h2>


<p>This is one of our fresh-water
marsh birds. I show you his
picture taken where he spends
most of his time.</p>

<p>If it were not for the note
calls, these tall reeds and grasses
would keep from us the secret
of the Rail&#8217;s home.</p>

<p>Like most birds, though, they
must be heard, and so late in the
afternoon you may hear their
clear note, ker-wee.</p>

<p>From all parts of the marsh
you will hear their calls which
they keep up long after darkness
has set in.</p>

<p>This Rail was just about to
step out from the grasses to
feed when the artist took his
picture. See him&mdash;head up, and
tail up. He steps along carefully.
He feels that it is risky
to leave his shelter and is ready
at the first sign of danger, to
dart back under cover.</p>

<p>There are very few fresh-water
marshes where the Rail is
not found.</p>

<p>When a boy, I loved to hear
their note calls and would spend
hours on the edge of a marsh
near my home.</p>

<p>It seemed to me there was no
life among the reeds and cat-tails
of the marsh, but when I
threw a stone among them, the
Rails would always answer with
their <em>peeps</em> or <em>keeks</em>.</p>

<p>And so I used to go down to
the marsh with my pockets filled
with stones. Not that I desired
or even expected to injure
one of these birds. Far from it.
It pleased me to hear their calls
from the reeds and grass that
seemed deserted.</p>

<p>Those of you who live near
wild-rice or wild-oat marshes
have a good chance to become
acquainted with this Rail.</p>

<p>In the south these Rails are
found keeping company with
the Bobolinks or Reed-birds as
they are called down there.</p>

<h2>THE KENTUCKY WARBLER.</h2>


<p>Although this bird is called
the Kentucky Warbler, we must
not think he visits that state
alone.</p>

<p>We find him all over eastern
North America. And a beautiful
bird he is.</p>

<p>As his name tells you he is
one of a family of Warblers.</p>

<p>I told you somewhere else
that the Finches are the largest
family of birds. Next to them
come the Warblers.</p>

<p>Turn back now and see how
many Warblers have been pictured
so far.</p>

<p>See if you can tell what things
group them as a family. Notice
their bills and feet.</p>

<p>This bird is usually found in
the dense woods, especially
where there are streams of
water.</p>

<p>He is a good singer, and his
song is very different from that
of any of the other Warblers.</p>

<p>I once watched one of these
birds&mdash;olive-green above and
yellow beneath. His mate was
on a nest near by and he was
entertaining her with his song.</p>

<p>He kept it up over two hours,
stopping only a few seconds
between his songs. When I
reached the spot with my field-glass
I was attracted by his
peculiar song. I don&#8217;t know
how long he had been singing.
I stayed and spent two hours
with him and he showed no
signs of stopping. He may be
singing yet. I hope he is.</p>

<p>You see him here perched on
a granite cliff. I suppose his
nest is near by.</p>

<p>He makes it of twigs and
rootlets, with several thicknesses
of leaves. It is neatly lined
with fine rootlets and you will
always find it on or near the
ground.</p>

<p>In the September and October
number of &ldquo;<span class="smcap">Birds</span>&rdquo; you will find
several Warblers and Finches.
Try to keep track of them and
may be you can do as many
others have done&mdash;tell the names
of new birds that come along by
their pictures which you have
seen in &ldquo;<span class="smcap">Birds</span>.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>THE KENTUCKY WARBLER.</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 81px;">
<img src="images/imgb.png" width="81" height="80" alt="B" title="" />
</div>
<p>ETWEEN sixty and seventy
warblers are described by
Davie in his &ldquo;Nests and
Eggs of North American
Birds,&rdquo; and the Kentucky
Warbler is recognized as one of the
most beautiful of the number, in its
manners almost the counterpart of the
Golden Crowned Thrush (soon to
delight the eyes of the readers of
<span class="smcap">Birds</span>), though it is altogether a
more conspicuous bird, both on
account of its brilliant plumage and
greater activity, the males being,
during the season of nesting, very
pugnacious, continually chasing one
another about the woods. It lives
near the ground, making its artfully
concealed nest among the low herbage
and feeding in the undergrowth, the
male singing from some old log or
low bush, his song recalling that of
the Cardinal, though much weaker.</p>

<p>The ordinary note is a soft
<em>schip</em>, somewhat like the common
call of the Pewee. Considering its
great abundance, says an observer, the
nest of this charmer is very difficult
to find; the female, he thought, must
slyly leave the nest at the approach of
an intruder, running beneath the
herbage until a considerable distance
from the nest, when, joined by her
mate, the pair by their evident anxiety
mislead the stranger as to its location.</p>

<p>It has been declared that no group
of birds better deserves the epithet
&ldquo;pretty&rdquo; than the Warblers. Tanagers
are splendid, Humming Birds refulgent,
others brilliant, gaudy, or magnificent,
but Warblers alone are pretty.</p>

<p>The Warblers are migratory birds,
the majority of them passing rapidly
across the United States in spring on
the way to their northern nesting
grounds, and in autumn to their winter
residence within the tropics. When
the apple trees bloom they revel
among the flowers, vieing in activity
and numbers with the bees; &ldquo;now
probing the recesses of a blossom for
an insect, then darting to another,
where, poised daintily upon a slender
twig, or suspended from it, they
explore hastily but carefully for
another morsel. Every movement is
the personification of nervous activity,
as if the time for their journey was
short; as, indeed, appears to be the
case, for two or three days at most suffice
some species in a single locality.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We recently saw a letter from a
gentleman living at Lake Geneva, in
which he referred with enthusiasm to
<span class="smcap">Birds</span>, because it had enabled him to
identify a bird which he had often
seen in the apple trees among the
blossoms, particularly the present
season, with which he was unacquainted
by name. It was the Orchard
Oriole, and he was glad to have a
directory of nature which would enable
him to add to his knowledge and correct
errors of observation. The idea is a
capitol one, and the beautiful Kentucky
Warbler, unknown to many who see
it often, may be recognized in the
same way by residents of southern
Indiana and Illinois, Kansas, some
localities in Ohio, particularly in the
southwestern portion, in parts of New
York and New Jersey, in the District
of Columbia, and in North Carolina.
It has not heretofore been possible,
even with the best painted specimens
of birds in the hand, to satisfactorily
identify the pretty creatures, but with
<span class="smcap">Birds</span> as a companion, which may
readily be consulted, the student cannot
be led into error.</p>

<h2>THE RED BREASTED MERGANSER.</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 116px;">
<img src="images/imgw.png" width="116" height="80" alt="W" title="" />
</div>
<p>HY this duck should be
called red-breasted is not
at first apparent, as at
a distance the color can
not be distinguished, but seen near, the
reason is plain. It is a common bird
in the United States in winter, where
it is found in suitable localities in the
months of May and June. It is also
a resident of the far north, breeding
abundantly in Newfoundland, Labrador,
Greenland, and Iceland. It is
liberally supplied with names, as Red-Breasted
Goosander or Sheldrake, Garbill,
Sea Robin, etc.</p>

<p>There is a difference in opinion as
to the nesting habits of the Red-Breast,
some authorities claiming that, like
the Wood Duck, the nest is placed in
the cavity of a tree, others that it is
usually found on the ground among
brushwood, surrounded with tall
grasses and at a short distance from
water. Davie says that most generally
it is concealed by a projecting
rock or other object, the nest being
made of leaves and mosses, lined with
feathers and down, which are plucked
from the breast of the bird. The observers
are all probably correct, the
bird adapting itself to the situation.</p>

<p>Fish is the chief diet of the Merganser,
for which reason its flesh is rank
and unpalatable. The Bird&#8217;s appetite
is insatiable, devouring its food in
such quantities that it has frequently
to disgorge several times before it is
able to rise from the water. This
Duck can swallow fishes six or seven
inches in length, and will attempt to
swallow those of a larger size, choking
in the effort.</p>

<p>The term Merganser is derived from
the plan of the bird&#8217;s bill, which is
furnished with saw teeth fitting into
each other.</p>

<p>The eggs of the Red-Breasted Merganser
vary from six to twelve, are
oval in shape, and are of a yellowish
or reddish-drab, sometimes a dull
buffy-green.</p>

<p>You may have seen pictures of this
Duck, which frequently figures in
dining rooms on the ornamental panels
of stuffed game birds, but none which
could cause you to remember its life-like
appearance. You here see before
you an actual Red-Breasted Merganser.</p>

<h2>BIRD SONG&mdash;<span class="sml">Continued from page <a href="#Page_41">41</a>.</span></h2>


<p>with exactness, will deceive Mistress
Pullet herself.</p>

<p>To carry the idea further, we will
take the notes of some of the birds
depicted in this number of <span class="smcap">Birds</span>.
The Osprey, or Fish-Hawk, has been
carefully observed, and his only discovered
note is a high, rapidly repeated
whistle, very plaintive. Doubtless
this noise is agreeable and intelligible
to his mate, but cannot be called a song,
and has no significance to the listener.</p>

<p>The Vulture utters a low, hissing
sound when disturbed. This is its
only note. Not so with the Bald
Eagle, whose scream emulates the rage
of the tempest, and implies courage,
the quality which associates him with
patriotism and freedom. In the notes
of the Partridge there is a meaning
recognizable by every one. After the
nesting season, when the birds are in
bevies, their notes are changed to what
sportsmen term &ldquo;scatter calls.&rdquo; Not
long after a bevy has been flushed,
and perhaps widely scattered, the
members of the disunited family may
be heard signaling to one another in
sweet minor calls of two and three
notes, and in excitement, they utter
low, twittering notes.</p>

<p>Of the Sora Rails, Mr. Chapman
says, &ldquo;knowing their calls, you have
only to pass a May or June evening
near a marsh to learn whether they
inhabit it. If there, they will greet
you late in the afternoon with a clear
whistled <em>ker-wee</em>, which soon comes
from dozens of invisible birds about
you, and long after night has fallen, it
continues like a springtime chorus of
piping hylas. Now and again it is
interrupted by a high-voiced, rolling
whinney, which, like a call of alarm,
is taken up and repeated by different
birds all over the marsh.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Poor Red-Breasted Merganser! He
has only one note, a croak. Perhaps
it was of him that Bryant was thinking
when he wrote the stanzas &ldquo;<a href="#Page_76">To a Water-Fowl</a>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The sentiment of feeling awakened
by any of the aquatic fowls is pre-eminently
one of loneliness,&rdquo; says John
Burroughs. &ldquo;The Wood Duck (see
July <span class="smcap">Birds</span>) which you approach,
starts from the pond or the marsh, the
Loon neighing down out of the April
sky, the Wild Goose, the Curlew, the
Stork, the Bittern, the Sandpiper, etc.,
awaken quite a different train of emotions
from those awakened by the land
birds. They all have clinging to them
some reminiscence and suggestion of
the sea. Their cries echo its wildness
and desolation; their wings are the
shape of its billows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the Evening Grosbeak, the
Kentucky Warbler, the Skylark, land
birds all, are singers. They have
music in their throats and in their
souls, though of varying quality. The
Grosbeak&#8217;s note is described by different
observers as a shrill <em>cheepy tee</em> and
a frog-like <em>peep</em>, while one writer remarks
that the males have a single
metallic cry like the note of a trumpet,
and the females a loud chattering like
the large Cherry Birds.</p>

<p>The Kentucky Warbler&#8217;s song is
entirely unlike that of any other
Warbler, and is a loud, clearly whistled
performance of five, six, or seven
notes, <em>turdle, turdle, turdle</em>, resembling
in tone some of the calls of the Carolina
Wren. He is so persistent in his
singing, however, that the Red-Breasted
Merganser&#8217;s simple croak would sometimes
be preferable to it.</p>

<p>But the Skylark&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 15em;">
        &ldquo;All the earth and air<br />
          <span style="margin-left: 1em;">With thy voice is loud,</span><br />
        As, when night is bare<br />
          <span style="margin-left: 1em;">From one lonely cloud</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: -5.5em;">The moon rains out her beams and heaven is over-flowed.&rdquo;</span></p>

<h2>THE YELLOW LEGS.</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 98px;">
<img src="images/imgy.png" width="98" height="80" alt="Y" title="" />
</div>
<p>ELLOW LEGS, or Lesser
Tell tale sometimes called
Yellow-leg Snipe, and Little
Cucu, inhabits the whole of
North America, nesting in the cold
temperate and subarctic districts of the
northern continent, migrating south
in winter to Argentine and Chili. It
is much rarer in the western than
eastern province of North America,
and is only accidental in Europe. It
is one of the wading birds, its food consisting
of larvae of insects, small shell
fish and the like.</p>

<p>The nest of the Lesser Yellow
Shanks, which it is sometimes called,
is a mere depression in the ground,
without any lining. Sometimes, however,
it is placed at the foot of a bush,
with a scanty lining of withered leaves.
Four eggs of light drab, buffy or cream
color, sometimes of light brown, are
laid, and the breast of the female is
found to be bare of feathers when engaged
in rearing the young. The
Lesser Yellow legs breeds in central
Ohio and Illinois, where it is a regular
summer resident, arriving about the
middle of April, the larger portion of
flocks passing north early in May and
returning about the first of September
to remain until the last of October.</p>

<p>A nest of this species of Snipe was
found situated in a slight depression at
the base of a small hillock near the
border of a prairie slough near Evanston,
Illinois, and was made of grass
stems and blades. The color of the
eggs in this instance was a deep grayish
white, three of which were marked
with spots of dark brown, and the
fourth egg with spots and well defined
blotches of a considerably lighter shade
of the same.</p>

<h2>THE SKYLARK.</h2>


<p>This is not an American bird.
I have allowed his picture to be
taken and placed here because
so many of our English friends
desired it.</p>

<p>The skylark is probably the
most noted of birds in Europe.
He is found in all of the countries
of Europe, but England
seems to claim it. Here it stays
during the summer, and goes
south in the winter.</p>

<p>Like our own Meadow Lark,
he likes best to stay in the fields.
Here you will find it when not
on the wing.</p>

<p>Early in the spring the Skylark
begins his song, and he may
be heard for most of the year.</p>

<p>Sometimes he sings while on
the ground, but usually it is
while he is soaring far above us.</p>

<p>Skylarks do not often seek
the company of persons. There
are some birds, you know, that
seem happy only when they are
near people. Of course, they
are somewhat shy, but as a rule
they prefer to be near people.
While the Skylark does not seek
to be near persons, yet it is not
afraid of them.</p>

<p>A gentleman, while riding
through the country, was surprised
to see a Skylark perch on
his saddle. When he tried to
touch it, the Lark moved along
on the horse&#8217;s back, and finally
dropped under the horse&#8217;s feet.
Here it seemed to hide. The
rider, looking up, saw a hawk
flying about. This explained the
cause of the skylark&#8217;s strange
actions.</p>

<p>A pair of these Larks had
built their nest in a meadow.
When the time came for mowing
the grass, the little ones
were not large enough to leave
the nest. The mother bird laid
herself flat on the ground, with
her wings spread out. The
father bird took one of the little
ones from the nest and placed
it on the mother&#8217;s back. She
flew away, took the baby bird
to a safe place, and came back
for another.</p>

<p>This time the father took his
turn. In this way they carried
the little ones to a safe place before
the mowers came.</p>

<p>Like our Meadow Lark, the
Skylark builds her nest on the
ground&mdash;never in bushes or
trees. Usually it is built in a
hole below the surface of the
ground. It is for this reason
that it is hard to find.</p>

<p>Then, too, the color of the nest
is much like that of the ground.</p>

<p>Four or five eggs are usually
laid, and in two weeks the little
larks crack the shells, and come
into the world crying for worms
and bugs.</p>

<h2>THE SKYLARK.</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 86px;">
<img src="images/imgt.png" width="86" height="80" alt="T" title="" />
</div>
<p>HE English Skylark has been
more celebrated in poetry than
any other song-bird. Shelley&#8217;s
famous poem is too long
to quote and too symmetrical to present
in fragmentary form. It is almost as
musical as the sweet singer itself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the first streak of dawn,&rdquo; says
one familiar with the Skylark, &ldquo;he
bounds from the dripping herbage,
and on fluttering wings mounts the
air for a few feet ere giving forth his
cheery notes. Then upward, apparently
without effort he sails, sometimes
drifting far away as he ascends, borne
as it were by the ascending vapors, so
easily he mounts the air. His notes
are so pure and sweet, and yet so loud
and varied withal, that when they first
disturb the air of early morning all the
other little feathered tenants of the
fields and hedgerows seem irresistibly
compelled to join him in filling the
air with melody. Upwards, ever upwards,
he mounts, until like a speck
in the highest ether he appears motionless;
yet still his notes are heard,
lovely in their faintness, now gradually
growing louder and louder as he
descends, until within a few yards of
the earth they cease, and he drops like
a fragment hurled from above into the
herbage, or flits about it for a short
distance ere alighting.&rdquo; The Lark
sings just as richly on the ground as
when on quivering wing. When in
song he is said to be a good guide to
the weather, for whenever we see him
rise into the air, despite the gloomy
looks of an overcast sky, fine weather
is invariably at hand.</p>

<p>The nest is most frequently in the
grass fields, sometimes amongst the
young corn, or in places little frequented.
It is made of dry grass and
moss, and lined with fibrous roots and
a little horse hair. The eggs, usually
four or five in number, are dull white,
spotted, clouded, and blotched over the
entire surface with brownish green.
The female Lark, says Dixon, like all
ground birds, is a very close sitter,
remaining faithful to her charge. She
regains her nest by dropping to the
ground a hundred yards or more from
its concealment.</p>

<p>The food of the Lark is varied,&mdash;in
spring and summer, insects and their
larvae, and worms and slugs, in autumn
and winter, seeds.</p>

<p>Olive Thorne Miller tells this pretty
anecdote of a Skylark which she
emancipated from a bird store: &ldquo;I
bought the skylark, though I did not
want him. I spared no pains to make
the stranger happy. I procured a
beautiful sod of uncut fresh grass, of
which he at once took possession,
crouching or sitting low among the
stems, and looking most bewitching.
He seemed contented, and uttered no
more that appealing cry, but he did
not show much intelligence. His cage
had a broad base behind which he
delighted to hide, and for hours as I
sat in the room I could see nothing of
him, although I would hear him stirring
about. If I rose from my seat he
was instantly on the alert, and stretched
his head up to look over at me. I
tried to get a better view of him by
hanging a small mirror at an angle
over his cage, but he was so much
frightened by it that I removed it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This bird,&rdquo; Mrs. Miller says &ldquo;never
seemed to know enough to go home.
Even when very hungry he would
stand before his wide open door, where
one step would take him into his
beloved grass thicket, and yet that one
step he would not take. When his
hunger became intolerable he ran
around the room, circled about his
cage, looking in, recognizing his food
dishes, and trying eagerly to get
between the wires to reach them; and
yet when he came before the open door
he would stand and gaze, but never
go in. After five months&#8217; trial, during
which he displayed no particular
intelligence, and never learned to enter
his cage, he passed out of the bird
room, but not into a store.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>WILSON&#8217;S PHALAROPE.</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 79px;">
<img src="images/imgp.png" width="79" height="80" alt="P" title="" />
</div>
<p>ERHAPS the most interesting,
as it is certainly the
most uncommon, characteristic
of this species of
birds is that the male relieves
his mate from all domestic duties
except the laying of the eggs. He
usually chooses a thin tuft of grass on
a level spot, but often in an open
place concealed by only a few straggling
blades. He scratches a shallow
depression in the soft earth, lines it
with a thin layer of fragments of old
grass blades, upon which the eggs,
three or four, are laid about the last of
May or first of June. Owing to the
low situation in which the nest is
placed, the first set of eggs are often
destroyed by a heavy fall of rain causing
the water to rise so as to submerge
the nest. The instinct of self preservation
in these birds, as in many others,
seems lacking in this respect. A
second set, numbering two or three, is
often deposited in a depression
scratched in the ground, as at first, but
with no sign of any lining.</p>

<p>Wilson&#8217;s Phalarope is exclusively
an American bird, more common in
the interior than along the sea coast.
The older ornithologists knew little of
it. It is now known to breed in
northern Illinois, Iowa, Wisconsin,
Minnesota, the Dakotas, Utah, and
Oregon. It is recorded as a summer
resident in northern Indiana and in
western Kansas. Mr. E. W. Nelson
states that it is the most common
species in northern Illinois, frequenting
grassy marshes and low prairies,
and is not exceeded in numbers even by
the ever-present Spotted Sandpiper.
While it was one of our most common
birds in the Calumet region it is now
becoming scarce.</p>

<p>The adult female of this beautiful
species is by far the handsomest of the
small waders. The breeding plumage
is much brighter and richer than that
of the male, another peculiar characteristic,
and the male alone possesses
the naked abdomen. The female
always remains near the nest while he
is sitting, and shows great solicitude
upon the approach of an intruder.
The adults assume the winter plumage
during July.</p>

<h2>THE EVENING GROSBEAK.</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 96px;">
<img src="images/imgh.png" width="96" height="80" alt="H" title="" />
</div>
<p>ANDSOMER birds there
may be, but in the opinion
of many this visitant to
various portions of western
North America is
in shape, color, and markings one of the
most exquisite of the feather-wearers.
It has for its habitation the region
extending from the plains to the Pacific
ocean and from Mexico into British
America. Toward the North it ranges
further to the east; so that, while it
appears to be not uncommon about
Lake Superior, it has been reported as
occuring in Ohio, New York, and Canada.
In Illinois it was observed at
Freeport during the winter of 1870
and 1871, and at Waukegan during
January, 1873. It is a common resident
of the forests of the State of
Washington, and also of Oregon. In the
latter region Dr. Merrill observed the
birds carrying building material to a
huge fir tree, but was unable to locate
the nest, and the tree was practically
inaccessable. Mr. Walter E. Bryant
was the first to record an authentic
nest and eggs of the Evening Grosbeak.
In a paper read before the California
Academy of Sciences he describes
a nest of this species containing
four eggs, found in Yolo county, California.
The nest was built in a small
live oak, at a height of ten feet, and
was composed of small twigs supporting
a thin layer of fibrous bark and a
lining of horse hair. The eggs are of
a clear greenish-ground color, blotched
with pale brown. According to Mr.
Davie, one of the leading authorities
on North American birds, little if any
more information has been obtained
regarding the nests and eggs of the
Evening Grosbeak.</p>

<p>As to its habits, Mr. O. P. Day says,
that about the year 1872, while hunting
during fine autumn weather in the
woods about Eureka, Illinois, he fell
in with a number of these Grosbeaks.
They were feeding in the tree tops on
the seeds of the sugar maple, just then
ripening, and were excessively fat.
They were very unsuspicious, and for
a long time suffered him to observe
them. They also ate the buds of
the cottonwood tree in company with
the Rose-Breasted Grosbeak.</p>

<p>The song of the Grosbeak is singularly
like that of the Robin, and to
one not thoroughly familiar with the
notes of the latter a difference would
not at first be detected. There is a very
decided difference, however, and by
repeatedly listening to both species in
full voice it will be discovered more
and more clearly. The sweet and
gentle strains of music harmonize delightfully,
and the concert they make
is well worth the careful attention of
the discriminating student. The value
of such study will be admitted by all
who know how little is known of the
songsters. A gentleman recently said
to us that one day in November
the greater part of the football field
at the south end of Lincoln Park
was covered with Snow Birds. There
were also on the field more than
one hundred grammar and high school
boys waiting the arrival of the football
team. There was only one
person present who paid any attention
to the birds which were picking
up the food, twittering, hopping, and
flying about, and occasionally indulging
in fights, and all utterly oblivious
of the fact that there were scores of
shouting school boys around and
about them. The gentleman called
the attention of one after another of
ten of the high school boys to the snow
birds and asked what they were. They
one and all declared they were English
Sparrows, and seemed astounded
that any one could be so ignorant as
not to know what an English Sparrow
was. So much for the city-bred boy&#8217;s
observation of birds.</p>

<h2>THE EVENING GROSBEAK.</h2>


<p>In the far Northwest we find
this beautiful bird the year
around. During the winter he
often comes farther south in
company with his cousin, the
Rose-Breasted Grosbeak.</p>

<p>What a beautiful sight it
must be to see a flock of these
birds&mdash;Evening Grosbeaks and
Rose-Breasted in their pretty
plumage.</p>

<p>Grosbeaks belong to a family
called Finches. The Sparrows,
Buntings, and Crossbills belong
to the same family. It is the
largest family among birds.</p>

<p>You will notice that they all
have stout bills. Their food is
mostly grains and their bills are
well formed to crush the seeds.</p>

<p>Look at your back numbers of
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Birds</span>&rdquo; and notice the pictures
of the other Finches I have
named. Don&#8217;t you think Dame
Nature is very generous with
her colors sometimes?</p>

<p>Only a few days ago while
strolling through the woods with
my field glass, I saw a pretty
sight. On one tree I saw a Redheaded
Woodpecker, a Flicker,
an Indigo Bunting, and a Rose-Breasted
Grosbeak. I thought
then, if we could only have the
Evening Grosbeak our group of
colors would be complete.</p>

<p>Have you ever wondered at
some birds being so prettily
dressed while others have such
dull colors?</p>

<p>Some people say that the birds
who do not sing must have
bright feathers to make them
attractive. We cannot believe
this. Some of our bright colored
birds are sweet singers, and
surely many of our dull colored
birds cannot sing very well.</p>

<p>Next month you will see the
pictures of several home birds.
See if dull colors have anything
to do with sweet song.</p>

<h2>THE TURKEY VULTURE.</h2>


<p>This bird is found mostly in
the southern states. Here he is
known by the more common
name of Turkey Buzzard.</p>

<p>He looks like a noble bird but
he isn&#8217;t. While he is well fitted
for flying, and might, if he tried,
catch his prey, he prefers to eat
dead animals.</p>

<p>The people down south never
think of burying a dead horse or
cow. They just drag it out
away from their homes and
leave it to the Vultures who are
sure to dispose of it.</p>

<p>It is very seldom that they
attack a live animal.</p>

<p>They will even visit the streets
of the cities in search of dead
animals for food, and do not
show much fear of man. Oftentimes
they are found among the
chickens and ducks in the barn-yard,
but have never been known
to kill any.</p>

<p>One gentleman who has
studied the habits of the Vulture
says that it has been known to
suck the eggs of Herons. This
is not common, though. As I
said they prefer dead animals
for their food and even eat their
own dead.</p>

<p>The Vulture is very graceful
while on the wing. He sails
along and you can hardly see
his wings move as he circles
about looking for food on the
ground below.</p>

<p>Many people think the Vulture
looks much like our tame turkey.</p>

<p>If you know of a turkey near
by, just compare this picture
with it and you won&#8217;t think so.</p>

<p>See how chalk-white his bill
is. No feathers on his head, but
a bright red skin.</p>

<p>What do you think of the young
chick? It doesn&#8217;t seem as
though he could ever be the
large, heavy bird his parent
seems to be.</p>

<p>Now turn back to the first

<h2>THE TURKEY VULTURE.</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 86px;">
<img src="images/imgt.png" width="86" height="80" alt="T" title="" />
</div>
<p>URKEY BUZZARD is the
familiar name applied to this
bird, on account of his remarkable
resemblance to our common
Turkey. This is the only respect
however, in which they are alike. It
inhabits the United States and British
Provinces from the Atlantic to the
Pacific, south through Central and
most of South America. Every farmer
knows it to be an industrious scavenger,
devouring at all times the putrid
or decomposing flesh of carcasses.
They are found in flocks, not only
flying and feeding in company, but
resorting to the same spot to roost;
nesting also in communities; depositing
their eggs on the ground, on rocks,
or in hollow logs and stumps, usually
in thick woods or in a sycamore grove,
in the bend or fork of a stream. The
nest is frequently built in a tree, or in
the cavity of a sycamore stump, though
a favorite place for depositing the
eggs is a little depression under a small
bush or overhanging rock on a steep
hillside.</p>

<p>Renowned naturalists have long
argued that the Vulture does not have
an extraordinary power of smell, but,
according to Mr. Davie, an excellent
authority, it has been proven by the
most satisfactory experiments that the
Turkey Buzzard does possess a keen
sense of smell by which it can distinguish
the odor of flesh at a great
distance.</p>

<p>The flight of the Turkey Vulture is
truly beautiful, and no landscape with
its patches of green woods and grassy
fields, is perfect without its dignified
figure high in the air, moving round in
circles, steady, graceful and easy, and
apparently without effort. &ldquo;It sails,&rdquo;
says Dr. Brewer, &ldquo;with a steady, even
motion, with wings just above the
horizontal position, with their tips
slightly raised, rises from the ground
with a single bound, gives a few flaps
of the wings, and then proceeds with
its peculiar soaring flight, rising very
high in the air.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Vulture pictured in the accompanying
plate was obtained between the
Brazos river and Matagorda bay. With
it was found the Black Vulture, both
nesting upon the ground. As the
nearest trees were thirty or forty miles
distant these Vultures were always
found in this situation. The birds
selected an open spot beneath a heavy
growth of bushes, placing the eggs
upon the bare ground. The old bird
when approached would not attempt
to leave the nest, and in the case of
the young bird in the plate, the female
to protect it from harm, promptly disgorged
the putrid contents of her
stomach, which was so offensive that
the intruder had to close his nostrils
with one hand while he reached for
the young bird with the other.</p>

<p>The Turkey Vulture is a very silent
bird, only uttering a hiss of defiance
or warning to its neighbors when feeding,
or a low gutteral croak of alarm
when flying low overhead.</p>

<p>The services of the Vultures as scavengers
in removing offal render them
valuable, and almost a necessity in
southern cities. If an animal is killed
and left exposed to view, the bird is
sure to find out the spot in a very short
time, and to make its appearance as if
called by some magic spell from the
empty air.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 15em;">
&ldquo;Never stoops the soaring Vulture<br />
On his quarry in the desert,<br />
On the sick or wounded bison,<br />
But another Vulture, watching,<br />
From his high aerial lookout,<br />
Sees the downward plunge and follows;<br />
And a third pursues the second,<br />
Coming from the invisible ether,<br />
First a speck, and then a Vulture,<br />
Till the air is dark with pinions.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>TO A WATER-FOWL.</h2>


<p style="margin-left: 12em;">
Whither, &#8217;midst falling dew<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">While glow the heavens with the last steps of day,</span><br />
Far through their rosy depths dost thou pursue<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thy solitary way?</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 12em;">
Vainly the fowler&#8217;s eye<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Might mark thy distant flight to do thee wrong,</span><br />
As, darkly painted on the crimson sky,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thy figure floats along.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 12em;">
Seek&#8217;st thou the plashy brink<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of weedy lake, or marge of river wide,</span><br />
Or where the rocky billows rise and sink<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">On the chafed ocean side.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 12em;">
There is a Power whose care<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Teaches thy way along that pathless coast&mdash;</span><br />
The desert and illimitable air&mdash;<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Lone wandering, but not lost.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 12em;">
All day thy wings have fanned,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">At that far height, the cold thin atmosphere,</span><br />
Yet stoop not, weary, to the welcome land<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Though the dark night is near.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 12em;">
And soon that toil shall end;<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Soon shalt thou find a summer home, and nest,</span><br />
And scream among thy fellows; reeds shall bend,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Soon o&#8217;er thy sheltered nest.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 12em;">
Thou&#8217;rt gone, the abyss of heaven<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Hath swallowed up thy form; yet on my heart</span><br />
Deeply has sunk the lesson thou hast given,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And shall not soon depart.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 12em;">
He who from zone to zone,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Guides through the boundless sky thy certain flight,</span><br />
In the long way that I must tread alone,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Will lead my steps aright.</span></p>

<h2>GAMBEL&#8217;S PARTRIDGE.</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 99px;">
<img src="images/imgg.png" width="99" height="80" alt="G" title="" />
</div>
<p>AMBEL&#8217;S PARTRIDGE, of
which comparatively little
is known, is a characteristic
game bird of Arizona and
New Mexico, of rare beauty, and with
habits similar to others of the species
of which there are about two hundred.
Mr. W. E. D. Scott found the species
distributed throughout the entire Catalina
region in Arizona below an altitude
of 5,000 feet. The bird is also
known as the Arizona Quail.</p>

<p>The nest is made in a depression in
the ground sometimes without any
lining. From eight to sixteen eggs
are laid. They are most beautifully
marked on a creamy-white ground
with scattered spots and blotches of
old gold, and sometimes light drab and
chestnut red. In some specimens the
gold coloring is so pronounced that it
strongly suggests to the imagination
that this quail feeds upon the grains
of the precious metal which characterizes
its home, and that the pigment
is imparted to the eggs.</p>

<p>After the nesting season these birds
commonly gather in &ldquo;coveys&rdquo; or bevies,
usually composed of the members of
but one family. As a rule they are
terrestrial, but may take to trees when
flushed. They are game birds <em>par excellence</em>,
and, says Chapman, trusting
to the concealment afforded by their
dull colors, attempt to avoid detection
by hiding rather than by flying. The
flight is rapid and accompanied by a
startling whirr, caused by the quick
strokes of their small, concave, stiff-feathered
wings. They roost on the
ground, tail to tail, with heads pointing
outward; &ldquo;a bunch of closely
huddled forms&mdash;a living bomb whose
explosion is scarcely less startling
than that of dynamite manufacture.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Partridge is on all hands admitted
to be wholly harmless, and at
times beneficial to the agriculturist.
It is an undoubted fact that it thrives
with the highest system of cultivation,
and the lands that are the most carefully
tilled, and bear the greatest quantity
of grain and green crops, generally
produce the greatest number of Partridges.</p>
